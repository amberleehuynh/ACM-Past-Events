# ACM's Past Events ðŸ“†
This webpage displays all of ACM's past events by fetching them through ACM UCSD Membership Portal API. These events are displayed in individual card components with the event name, location, date/ time, and points. The events are also linked to their corresponding page on ACM's main website when clicked on. There is a feature for users to search through the list of events and only display the matching results.
